iswim - #lang for writing ISWIM terms and helping to write ISWIM interpeters

----

```
#lang iswim
X := M
...
M
```

```
M = X
  | b
  | (Î» (X ...+) M)
  | (M N ...+)
  | (o M ...)
  | (let ([X M] ...) M)
b = number
  | string
o = add1
  | +
  | *
```

Line comments are written with `;;`

Multi-arity functions and function applications are implicitly
curried. `let` abbreviates function definition and application.

Definitions are inlined into term before evaluation, and thus are not recursive.

Evaluation is call-by-value.
